## 2. About this visa
Visa arrangements for Norfolk Island residents and former entry permit holders
The Norfolk Island Immigration Act 1980 has been repealed and Norfolk Island has been integrated into the Australian migration zone. 
- We have made transitional visa arrangements for residents of Norfolk Island and people who held a Norfolk Island immigration permit to ensure they are not disadvantaged by this change. The transitional arrangements offer non-citizen permit holders and residents rights and benefits comparable to those they had under the repealed act. 
- On 1 July 2016, all non-citizens who were permanent residents of Norfolk Island under the Norfolk Island Immigration Act 1980 were taken to have been granted a comparable permanent Australian visa.
- You are also considered to have been granted a comparable Australian visa if, on 30 June 2016, you held one of these permits under the Norfolk Island Immigration Act 1980: 
- 
- a temporary entry permit (TEP)
- a general entry permit (GEP)
- an unrestricted entry permit (UEP)
- 
- Norfolk Island permanent residents
- We take you to have been granted the Confirmatory Residence visa (subclass 808) if, at the end of 30 June 2016 
- 
- held a Permanent Resident of Norfolk Island visa (subclass 834) visa under the Migration Act 1958 or  
- you were a resident of Norfolk Island under the repealed Act and did not hold a Australian permanent visa under the Migration Act 1958 at that time
- 
- Norfolk Island entry permit holders
- We consider you were granted a Provisional Resident return visa (subclass 159) if at the end of 30 June 2016 you:
- 
- held a temporary entry permit or general entry permit under the repealed act, and
- did not hold a permanent visa under the Migration Act 1958.
- 
- New Zealand citizens
- We consider you were granted a Special Category visa (subclass 444) if at the end of 30 June 2016 you:
- 
- held an unrestricted entry permit (UEP) under the repealed act, and
- did not hold a permanent visa under the Migration Act 1958
- 
- If you held a temporary visa under the Migration Act 1958, that visa would remain in effect unless it was a:
- 
- Visitor visa (subclass 600)
- Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)
- eVisitor (subclass 651)
- 
- This means that unless you applied for and were granted another visa, the subclass 444 visa only came into effect when your current visa expired or expires. 
- See more about the Special Category visa (subclass 444).
- International travellers
- If you are travelling between Norfolk Island and a country other than Australia you are subject to Australian immigration requirements in line with the Australian Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations 1994. You must have an appropriate Australian visa to enter, visit or live in Norfolk Island.
- Explore your visa options.
