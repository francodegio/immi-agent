## 4. Step by Step
Before you apply
See if you hold a Maritime Crew visa that is still valid with the Maritime Crew visa online status enquiry page.
Ensure you apply for the visa well ahead of your travel. We may require further information from you and time to assess that information.
Do not travel to Australia without a valid visa.
Ensure that you enter Australia on a Maritime Crew visa eligible ship, which is a ship that:

is transporting commercial cargo between Australia and international ports
is carrying paying passengers
is owned and operated by a foreign government to do scientific research
has been approved for 'Public Vessel Status' by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
has been imported or entered for home consumption under specific sections of Australia’s Customs Act 1901 and is registered on the Australian International Shipping Register.

Check your passport

If you plan to get a new passport, you should do so before applying for your visa. Your visa is linked to the passport number you use in your application.
You and your family members need valid passports before we will grant this visa.
A seafarer's identity document is not acceptable with the exception of Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese seafarer passports. If you hold both a seafarer's passport and a national passport, you should apply using your national passport.



If your previous Maritime crew visa is still valid


 you should not apply for another one unless it is going to expire before you are going to enter Australia or during your voyage in Australia as a member of crew of a non-military ship. You must not arrive or be in Australia without a visa.
and you want to fly to Australia to join a ship, you will need another visa to enter Australia. You could apply for a Transit visa (subclass 771), or another visa that lets you enter Australia by air.
You can hold a Maritime Crew visa at the same time as you hold another visa. Your Maritime Crew visa will be the visa in effect while you are signed on to a non-military ship. If you sign off your ship in Australia and you don't hold another visa to stay in Australia, you have five days to depart or apply for another visa to stay in Australia, or your Maritime Crew visa will cease.
