## 3. Elegibility
Have this visa 

If you are in Australia at the time you apply, you must hold one of the following: 

a substantive visa
Bridging visa A - BVA - (subclass 010)
Bridging visa B - BVA - (subclass 020)
Bridging visa C - BVC - (subclass 030)

If you currently hold or your last substantive visa held was either: 

Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) (subclass 491); or 
Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) (subclass 494)

You must have held that visa for at least 3 years at the time you apply. 




Be invited to apply

You can only apply for this visa if we invite you to. See before you apply.
Submit an expression of interest (EOI) to let us know you would like to apply for the visa.
After you have submitted an EOI, you might be nominated for the visa by a state or territory government. We will only invite you to apply for this visa if you are nominated.




Be nominated

You must have been nominated for this visa by an Australian state or territory government agency.
Submit a completed expression of interest (EOI) in SkillSelect. State and territory government agencies can see your completed EOI and might nominate you for the visa.
If you are nominated for the visa, we will invite you to apply.
All state and territory government agencies have their own criteria for deciding who they will nominate. Contact the state or territory agency directly to find out more about their nomination process and what they want from you.

Australian Capital Territory
New South Wales
Northern Territory
Queensland
South Australia
Tasmania
Victoria
Western Australia

If the state or territory agency that nominates you withdraws your nomination after you have applied, your application becomes invalid.




Have a suitable skills assessment

For your application to be valid, you must declare that you have a suitable skills assessment at the time of invitation.
Delegates of the Minister will now accept a suitable skills assessment for an applicantâ€™s nominated skilled occupation which has been obtained within the 60 day invitation period.
This change of approach is made as a result of the decision of Thapa v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2021] FCCA 686 (Thapa). The Minister will administer the Migration Regulations 1994 in accordance with the decision in Thapa, but the Minister reserves the right to make submissions in a Court that Thapa was wrongly decided.
You will need to provide a copy of this skills assessment with your application.
For medical and legal practitioners, we also accept the following as proof of a skills assessment:

full or unconditional or general medical registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency
conditional specialist registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. This only allows you to practise in your speciality. You need no further training or supervision
admission to practice law in the relevant state or territory

Your skills assessment must have been obtained in the 3 years before the date of your invitation. If the assessment was for a shorter period, that period must not have passed.
If your skills were assessed on the basis of a qualification you got in Australia when you held a student visa, the qualification must be from studying a course registered on CRICOS. 




Be this age

You must be aged under 45 when we invite you to apply for the visa.
You can still apply for the visa if you turn 45 after we invite you to apply.
If you turn 45 after you submit your EOI but before we invite you to apply, you will not be invited to apply.




Be able to score 65 points or more

The subclass 190 is a points-tested visa.
When you submit your EOI in SkillSelect you will be given an indicative points score based on the claims you have made. If you do not obtain a score of 65 points you will not be invited to apply for this visa.
If we do invite you to apply for the visa, your invitation will state the number of points that you must score when we assess your application for grant of the visa (this score may be higher than 65 points, depending on your claims in the EOI).  
When you lodge your application you must provide evidence supporting your claims. 
To check how points can be awarded refer to the points calculator.



Have this level of English language

At the time of invitation, you must have at least competent English.




Meet the skills requirement

Your occupation must be on the relevant list of eligible skilled occupations for the 190 Skilled Nominated visa




Meet our health requirement

You and any family who apply for the visa with you must meet our health requirement.
If requested, family members not accompanying you to Australia might also need to meet our health requirement.




Meet our character requirement

You and family members aged 16 years and over who apply for the visa with you must meet our character requirement.
Family members not accompanying you to Australia must also meet the character requirement.




Have paid back your debt to the Australian government

If you or any family members (including those who do not apply for the visa with you) owe the Australian Government money, you or they must have paid it back or arranged to pay it back.




Sign the Australian values statement

If you are 18 years of age or older, you must:

have read, or had explained to you, the Life in Australia and
confirm you will respect the Australian way of life and obey Australian laws when you sign an Australian Values Statement 





Not  had a visa cancelled or a previous application refused

We will consider your immigration history when we make a decision on your application, which means you might not be eligible for this visa if you have had a visa cancelled or refused.
In some circumstances you may still apply for a permanent visa if you have had a visa cancelled or an application refused see Limitations on applications in Australia.
If applying for a visa from outside Australia see Can I go to Australia.
If you want immigration assistance, see Who can help with your visa application.







## 4. Step by Step
Before you apply
You must submit an expression of interest (EOI) through SkillSelect to let us know you want to apply for this visa.

Organise health exams
We prefer that you have any health checks before you apply for the visa.
Find out the examinations you need and how to arrange them.





Help with your EOI

If you need help with your EOI you can use a registered migration agent or legal practitioner. For information on how to find someone to help you see Who can help you with your application.




Step 1.1 â€“ Before you submit your EOI

You must submit an expression of interest (EOI) to let us know you want to apply for this visa.

Check your occupation
Your occupation must be on the relevant list of eligible skilled occupations for the Skilled Nominated (subclass 190) visa.





Get your skills assessed

You must have a suitable skills assessment at the time we invite you to apply.
The assessment must be undertaken by an assessing authority listed against your occupation in the list of eligible skilled occupations. You might have to pay for the assessment.
To be eligible for a visa your skills assessment must have been obtained within the 3 years before the date of invitation. If the assessment was for a shorter period, that period must not have passed.  We can't accept a skills assessment issued more than 3 years before the invitation date.
If your skills were assessed on the basis of a qualification you got in Australia when you held a student visa, the qualification must be from studying a course registered on CRICOS.
 
Medical practitioners
For medical practitioners we accept evidence of registration issued by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. You must hold either:

unconditional or general medical registration
conditional specialist registration â€“ which allows you to practice only in your particular specialty with no further training or supervision requirements

You must show that you hold this registration at the time we invite you to apply.

Barristers and solicitors
A suitable skills assessment for barristers and solicitors is evidence of admission to practice as a lawyer in an Australian state or territory.
The relevant legal admissions authority must have admitted you to practice at the time we invite you to apply.




Check your points

You must be able to obtain at least 65 points on our points test to be eligible for this visa. If you cannot obtain 65 points we will not invite you to apply.
If we invite you to apply for the visa, you must prove the claims you make in your EOI when we assess your application.
Use the points calculator to check how many points you might score




Check you meet the other eligibility criteria

Check that you meet all other eligibility criteria for the visa.
If we invite you to apply for the visa, you will have to support the claims you make in your EOI as well as other criteria if you submit an application.
See what documents you will need to prove your claims before you submit your EOI in the Gather documents section below.







Step 1.2 â€“ Submit your EOI

Submit your EOI via Skillselect. You can submit it from within or outside Australia.
Your EOI is not a visa application. There is no fee for submitting an EOI.
Select the Skill Nominated (subclass 190) visa.
You will receive an email confirming your EOI has been submitted.




Step 1.3 â€“ After you submit your EOI

SkillSelect will estimate your points score based on the claims made in your EOI.
You must have an estimated score of at least 65 points to be invited to apply for this visa.
Once your EOI is submitted it will be visible to state and territory governments. If you have the skills they need, a state or territory government agency might nominate you for the visa.
If you are nominated, you will get an invitation to apply for this visa.

Stay lawful

An EOI is not a visa application. 
If you submit an EOI in Australia and your current visa is about to expire, you must apply for another visa to stay in Australia lawfully. 
You are not eligible for a bridging visa because the EOI is not a visa application. You are only eligible for a bridging visa after you are invited and apply for this visa.
 




Make changes to your EOI

Let us know through SkillSelect if:

you want to apply for a different skilled visa
your circumstances change - for example, if you change your occupation or your family structure changes
you could score more points - for example, you have completed a higher qualification or gained new work experience
your employment circumstances change and you are no longer working at least 20 hours per week in your nominated occupation

You must be able to meet the points score on your invitation letter if we invite you to apply or you will not be granted a visa.
SkillSelect will update your indicative points score if you make changes to your EOI. You can change your EOI at any time before we invite you to apply for a visa.







Step 1.4 - Receive an invitation to apply for visa

We allocate places for the skilled migration program to meet the Australian Governmentâ€™s migration planning levels. 
Once invited, you have 60 calendar days to apply for the visa. We cannot extend this time.
You could receive an invitation up to 2 years after submitting an EOI. If we invite you to apply you will receive an email from SkillSelect. Getting an invitation does not mean you will be granted the visa.
The invitation will include the number of points you must score based on your EOI claims.
After you apply for the visa, you must show that you:

can meet the points score on your invitation (which will include proving any claims you made in your EOI) and
can meet all other eligibility criteria

If you do not apply for the visa after two invitations, your EOI will be removed from SkillSelect.
We will not process your visa application if you are 45 at the time of your invitation.

If you can't show you meet the points score or other eligibility criteria

If you can't show you meet the points score on your invitation or the other visa criteria, then do not apply for the visa.
Your EOI will be suspended if an invitation is issued, but you can update information once the 60-day invitation period has passed. If this is your second invitation, you will have to submit another EOI if you still want the visa.







Get help with your application
