The demand for these visas is greater than the number of places available each year. As a result, processing times for these applications can be lengthy.

- 
- you do not fill it in correctly

- your information takes a long time to verify.

- Other Parent visas available include the:
- 
- Contributory Aged Parent visa (subclass 864) which is a permanent visa but costs more.
- Contributory Aged Parent (Temporary) visa (subclass 884), then a permanent Contributory Aged Parent visa (subclass 864). This 2-step visa process costs more than the subclass 804 visa. It also costs more than applying directly for the Contributory Aged Parent visa (subclass 864), but the cost is spread across the 2 visas over a longer period.
- Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa (subclass 870) which is a temporary visa allowing parents to visit their children in Australia for up to three or five years at a time and a cumulative maximum 10 year period.
