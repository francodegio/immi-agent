- to visit family or friends
- as a business visitor
- 
- You can study or train for up to 3 months in total on this visa. But if your main reason for travelling to Australia is study, a student visa might be more appropriate.

- Cruise
- You will need a visa if you enter Australia during a cruise.
- If your cruise is a round trip cruise, the time you spend on the cruise counts as time spent in Australia - that is, we do not consider you have left Australia. A round trip cruise will not reset your stay period on your visa.

- work for or provide services to a business or organisation based in Australia
