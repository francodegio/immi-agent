We will not refund the application fee if we refuse your application.
If your Safe Haven Enterprise visa application has been finally determined, and you do not engage Australia's protection obligations and you do not hold another visa, you do not have a lawful right to stay in Australia.
You will need to return to your home country or to another country where you have right of entry.
If you become unlawful in Australia and do not depart voluntarily, we will take steps to remove you from Australia.
If we refuse your SHEV application or cancel your SHEV after we have granted it, and you have exhausted all appeal rights, you can ask the Minister for Home Affairs to intervene in your case. The Minister does not have to consider your request.

Leaving Australia
Before you leave

- 
- seek our written approval under Travel Condition 8570 before you travel

- check that your DFAT travel document allows you to enter the country you want to visit

- You should not use the passport or travel document issued to you by your country of nationality. If you do so, we may consider that you no longer need Australia's protection and we may cancel your visa.
- TPV and SHEV holders are eligible to apply for a travel document issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).
- Contact any Australian Passport Office in DFAT to apply for a Convention Travel Document or a Certificate of Identity .
- Obtain our written approval to travel overseas before leaving

- If you travel overseas without our written approval, you will breach visa condition 8570. As a result, we may cancel your visa (and the visas of members of your same family unit) while you are offshore.
- If you enter the country from which we granted you protection, even for a short time, you will breach visa condition 8570. As a result, we may cancel your visa (and the visas of members of your same family unit).
