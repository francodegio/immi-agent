## 2. About this visa
Overview
The Australian Government has fulfilled its election commitment to make Temporary Protection visa (TPV) and Safe Haven Enterprise visa (SHEV) holders eligible to apply for a permanent Resolution of Status (RoS) visa.
- Providing permanent residence to TPV and SHEV holders empowers them to move forward with their lives. It increases their ability to contribute to Australian society. Permanent residency will enable TPV/SHEV holders to:
- 
- gain secure employment
- grow businesses
- study more easily
- sponsor eligible family members to Australia
- eventually become an Australian citizen.
- 
- Anyone who has submitted a TPV or SHEV application before 14 February 2023 that has not been finally determined, has had the existing application automatically converted to a RoS visa application. This includes subsequent TPV or SHEV applications.
- Current TPV and SHEV holders who had not submitted a subsequent TPV or SHEV application before 14 February 2023 can apply for a RoS visa online via ImmiAccount. They must apply before their current TPV or SHEV ceases to remain lawful.
- We are committed to supporting the transition to a Resolution of Status visa for those who held or have applied for a TPV or SHEV before 14 February 2023. We expect that we will grant the majority of TPV/SHEV holders who meet the requirements for the grant of a RoS visa within 12 months of processing commencement.
- If you have any concerns about your eligibility to apply for a RoS visa, you can contact specialist community legal service providers (listed in the Factsheet below). If you need assistance, you can also contact the Department’s Status Resolution Service for assistance.

With this visa, you can:

- live, work and study in Australia permanently
- access government services such as Medicare and Centrelink services
- access short-term counselling for torture and trauma
- sponsor eligible family members for permanent residence through the family visa stream of the Migration Program
- travel to and from Australia for 5 years
- if eligible, become an Australian citizen
- if eligible, attend English language classes for free.
- 

Requirements 
All applicants need to meet health, character and security requirements. Any applicants aged 18 or over must sign the Australian Values Statement.
- You may be asked to provide additional identity information, or to clarify information in relation to your identity. In some cases this may require an interview. The Department will contact you if additional information is required.

Converted TPV or SHEV applications 
If you applied for an initial TPV or SHEV before 14 February 2023 you do not need to apply for a RoS visa. If we find that you meet the criteria for the TPV or SHEV, the Department will convert your application to an application for a RoS visa. The Department will notify you if you have been granted a RoS visa.
- You do not need to apply for a RoS visa if you hold a TPV or SHEV and have applied for a subsequent TPV or SHEV before 14 February 2023. The Department has converted your application to an application for a RoS visa. The Department will notify you if we have granted you a RoS visa.

Current TPV and SHEV holders (with no application before the Department)
Current TPV and SHEV holders who had not submitted a subsequent TPV or SHEV application before 14 February 2023 can apply for a RoS visa. You must apply before your current TPV or SHEV ceases to remain lawful.
- You must apply for a RoS visa online via ImmiAccount.
- Online applications for a RoS visa include the notification of an application bar lift (as unauthorised maritime arrivals are otherwise subject to the application bar in section 46A of the Migration Act 1958).
- For assistance with ImmiAccount technical issues see Technical help. If you are still unable to lodge your application you can contact our Global Service Centre, or the legal service provider in your state or territory for free assistance. For a list of providers see the RoS visa factsheet.
- There are limited circumstances where we will authorise applicants to lodge a RoS visa application using the paper application form (including verified ImmiAccount systems issues).

Extending your TPV or SHEV
We will extend the TPV/SHEV of current TPV or SHEV holders who make a valid application for a RoS visa until we have made a decision on the RoS visa. To ensure that your TPV or SHEV is extended and that you remain lawful, you must apply for a RoS visa before it ceases.

If you are currently unlawful
If you are currently an unlawful non-citizen because your TPV or SHEV expired before 14 February 2023, note that an application for a RoS visa is also an application for a bridging visa.
- For current TPV or SHEV holders, you must apply for a RoS visa before your TPV or SHEV ceases.

How long can you stay
This is a permanent visa. It lets you stay in Australia indefinitely.
- You become an Australian permanent resident on the day we grant your visa.
- For Australian citizenship purposes, your permanent residence starts on the day we grant your visa.

Including family members
Family members may apply together on the same application form. Each applicant must meet the requirements in their own right for the grant of the visa.
- Newborn child
- If a child is born after you submit your application and before we make a decision on your application, we will include the child in that application. You must tell us as soon as possible by completing Form 1022 Notification of change of circumstances. You must also provide a clear colour copy of the child's original birth certificate, and attach both of these documents in ImmiAccount or send them via email to the address provided in your RoS visa or subsequent TPV or SHEV application acknowledgement letter.
- If a child is born in Australia, they are automatically granted the same visa their parents hold at the time of the child’s birth.
- If either parent is an Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth, the child will be an Australian citizen by birth. In such cases an Australian citizenship certificate should be obtained and attached in ImmiAccount. For more details see: Get a citizenship certificate.

- Irregular travel to Australia
- The Government remains committed to Operation Sovereign Borders. Australia’s border protection policies have not and will not change. Any person who attempts to travel to Australia irregularly will not settle permanently here.
- Anyone who attempts to travel to Australia by voyage without a valid visa will be turned back to their point of departure, returned to their home country or transferred to another country.
- Australia's tough border protection policies are designed to protect Australia's borders, combat people smuggling and deter people from attempting dangerous boat voyages across the open ocean.
- The Government’s policy on transitory persons remains unchanged. Transitory persons will not settle in Australia. We encourage them to engage in third country migration options including:
- 
- Resettlement in the United States or New Zealand or private sponsorship in Canada
- Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) home or to another country in which they have right of entry.

## 3. Elegibility
Meet the visa requirements

To make a valid application for a Resolution of Status visa, you must be a holder (or former holder, and your visa was not cancelled) of one of the below visas:

Temporary Protection visa (subclass 785) – and you first arrived in Australia before 14 February 2023
Safe Haven Enterprise visa (subclass 790) – and you first arrived in Australia before 14 February 2023

From 14 February 2023, TPV and SHEV holders who held their TPV or SHEV before this date are eligible to apply for a RoS visa. You can apply online via ImmiAccount.
People who have submitted a TPV or SHEV application prior to 14 February 2023 that has not been finally determined, will have their existing application automatically converted to a RoS visa application. This includes any subsequent TPV or SHEV application.
If you currently hold a bridging visa and you made a valid application for a TPV or SHEV before 14 February 2023, the Department will convert your TPV or SHEV application to a Resolution of Status visa application. You must satisfy the requirements for the grant of a TPV or SHEV.




Not be barred from lodging a Resolution of Status (RoS) visa application

You cannot make a valid RoS visa application while you are subject to an application bar. This includes the section 46A bar for Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals.
The online application form for a RoS visa includes the notification of a section 46A application bar lift. You must make your application online via ImmiAccount, unless the Department has authorised you to lodge a paper application form and notified you in writing of an application bar lift.
There are limited circumstances where we will authorise applicants to lodge a RoS visa application using the paper application form (including verified ImmiAccount systems issues). If you are experiencing difficulties lodging online, you should refer to the Technical help. You may also contact the legal service provider in your state or territory for free assistance. For a list of providers see the RoS visa factsheet.



Not previously had your most recent TPV or SHEV refused or cancelled 

If we cancelled your most recent TPV or SHEV, or your TPV or SHEV application was refused and finally determined, you cannot make a valid application for a Resolution of Status visa.
We expect that people found not to engage protection obligations and, whose application has been finally determined by any merits and judicial review processes, will depart Australia. We may provide these people assistance to depart.
If you have new, credible protection claims relating to changes in your country of origin or personal circumstances, you may request Ministerial Intervention.
The Minister will not consider protection claims that have already been considered in a Protection visa application or by the Tribunal. Requests will only be considered where a person is making genuine and compelling claims that require consideration when these claims could not be raised in their initial protection visa application. If the Minister does not intervene in your case, the Minister expects you to leave Australia when your current visa expires.




Meet our identity requirements

You may be asked to provide documents as evidence of your identity, nationality or citizenship to support your application.
We may also ask you to provide biometrics (a scan of your fingerprints and a digital photograph of your face) as part of your application, if you have not provided them to us before.
If you are invited to provide identity information and you do not provide this within the timeframe provided, you will be provided with an opportunity to explain why you could not provide the information, and the steps that you took to obtain the information. If you do not make a genuine attempt to establish your identity, the department may consider refusing your application.
If the department requests identity information from you and, following your response, has substantial concerns with a previous finding in relation to your identity, we will assess whether you meet at least one of the following criteria before granting your visa:

You would satisfy the criteria for the grant of a protection visa (including engaging Australia’s protection obligations).
There is a compelling or compassionate reason for you to be granted a RoS visa (this could include, for example, family circumstances, health needs or a positive contribution to Australian society).
You are a member of the same family unit as a person who holds a RoS visa.





Meet our security requirements

As part of the application process, we will assess whether you meet Australia’s security requirements for the grant of a Resolution of Status visa.




Meet our health requirements

You may need to undergo health examinations. This will protect your health and the health of the Australian community. We may waive the health requirements if you have already satisfied the health requirements for the grant of a TPV or SHEV.
These examinations will be conducted by Bupa Medical Visa Services.
after you have lodged your visa application if required, we will give you a health identifier (HAP ID) and information about how to arrange your health examinations.




Meet our character requirements

You must meet certain character requirements.




Sign the Australian values statement

If you are 18 years of age or older, you must have read, or had explained to you, the booklet, Life in Australia.
You must also confirm you will respect the Australian way of life and obey Australian laws when you sign or accept the Australian Values Statement.







## 4. Step by Step
Before you apply
Check that you are eligible and check when your current TPV or SHEV ceases. You can prepare and submit your application yourself or, if you need help, you can get someone to act on your behalf. You should start this process well before your TPV or SHEV ceases. If you do not apply before your current visa ceases you will become unlawful and may lose access to Government services.
For more information see Eligibility.

Get help with your application

Only some people can help you with your application. If you appoint someone to give you immigration assistance they must be one of the following:

Registered migration agent
Legal practitioner
Exempt person

You can appoint anyone to receive documents on your behalf relating to your visa matter. For more information see Receiving Documents.
You can get free legal assistance to apply for a RoS visa.
While not mandatory, we encourage TPV/SHEV holders who are applying for a RoS visa to contact the specialist legal service provider in their state for free support.

Note: The Department of Home Affairs does not charge a fee to fast-track a visa. If you get offered this service, it is a scam.
