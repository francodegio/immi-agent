## 2. About this visa
Intercountry adoption
We can't help arrange adoptions and we do not issue letters of no objection. Our role is to assess and decide applications for visas.
- Learn more about adopting a child overseas from Intercountry Adoptions Australia.​​
- We are unable to accept adoption visa applications for children who have been adopted in Pakistan.

With this visa the child can

- stay in Australia indefinitely with their adoptive parent
- work and study in Australia
- enrol in Australia's public healthcare scheme, Medicare
- sponsor their relatives to come to Australia
- apply for Australian citizenship, if eligible 
- 
- Travel to and from Australia for 5 years
- The child can travel to and from Australia as many times as they want for 5 years from the date we grant this visa. This is as long as the travel facility on this visa remains valid.
- If the child wants to travel after the initial 5-year travel facility:
- 
- they will need to apply for and be granted a Resident Return (RRV) so they can re-enter Australia as a permanent resident
- they might also want to consider Australian citizenship. If they become an Australian citizen, they don't require a visa to enter Australia. They will need to apply for an Australian passport and use it to leave and re-enter Australia. See more about eligibility requirements and current processing times for Australian citizenship
- 
- To see when the child's travel facility ends, use VEVO.

How long the child can stay

## 3. Elegibility
You must meet all of the following eligibility criteria to be eligible for this visa.
Be adopted or in the process of being adopted

To be eligible to apply for an Adoption visa (subclass 102), the child must:

have been or be in the process of being adopted through an intercountry adoption or arrangement with the involvement of an Australian state or territory central authority, or
have been or be in the process of being adopted through an intercountry adoption between 2 countries (other than Australia) that are parties to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Adoption Convention), or
have been adopted through an expatriate adoption (with no Australian state or territory central authority being involved). The adoption must be by an Australian citizen, an eligible New Zealand citizen or the holder of an Australian permanent visa. They must have been residing outside Australia for more than 12 months immediately before lodging the visa application.

For further information on adopting a child see Intercountry Adoptions Australia.​​

Children adopted under the Hague Adoption Convention

A child may be eligible for Australian Citizenship if the intercountry adoption is:

finalised outside Australia under the Hague Convention, or
a recognised bilateral arrangement.

If we grant the child Australian citizenship they can enter Australia on an Australian passport and will not need to apply for a visa.
For further information see Become an Australian citizen (by adoption).
 




Expatriate adoptions

Australian Government has no role
The Australian Government, including the Department of Home Affairs, has no role in the overseas expatriate adoption process.
The Australian Government, including our Department, does not provide documents that support or endorse expatriate adoptions overseas. This includes letters of support or certificates of no objection.
If an overseas authority asks you to obtain a document of support for an expatriate adoption, you can advise them to email info@intercountryadoption.gov.au
We only assess and decide adoption visa applications. A visa will only be granted if all eligibility requirements are met.
Eligibility requirements for expatriate adoptees entering Australia
If the child is adopted through an expatriate adoption, and you (the adoptive parent) are considering bringing them to Australia, then, amongst other criteria, all of the following must be met:

at least one adoptive parent must have resided outside Australia for more than 12 months immediately before lodging a visa application
the adoptive parent must not have resided overseas to avoid Australia’s intercountry adoption laws
the adoptive parent must have full and permanent parental rights (no remaining legal ties between the child and the birth parents can exist)
the adoption must adhere to adoption laws of the home country.

Seek legal advice
If a child has been legally adopted in an overseas country (not Australia) under that country's law, it does not guarantee that the overseas adoption will meet the requirements of an Adoption (Subclass 102) visa.
We recommend you obtain independent legal advice both in Australia and in the child’s country of usual residence before proceeding with an expatriate adoption.







Have a sponsor

The child must be sponsored by an eligible adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent.
We must approve the sponsorship. We might not approve sponsorship if the sponsor or their partner has been charged or convicted of offences involving children. Learn more about measures for the protection of children.




Be this age 
The child must be under 18 at the time of adoption, when the application is submitted and when we make our decision.




Meet the health requirement

The child and any dependent child who applies for the visa with them must meet our health requirement.
If we can consider a health waiver for an adoption visa applicant, we will examine your circumstances carefully. Learn more about health waivers.
Family members who are not coming to Australia might also have to meet our health requirement.




Meet the character requirement
If the child is aged 16 years or older they must meet our character requirement.
We might also ask that any other dependent child who applies for the visa meet the requirement.





Repay debt to the Australian Government
If the child or any member of the child's family owes the Australian Government money it must be paid back or there must be a formal arrangement to pay it back.





Best interests of the child
We might not grant this visa if it is not in the best interests of an applicant under 18.
