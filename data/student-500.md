Students affected by COVID-19
If you held a Student visa on or after 1 February 2020, you may be eligible to have your visa application fee waived so you can submit a further Student visa application. You may be eligible if you:

- You must apply for a Student visa to have your application for a fee waiver considered. Attach a completed Form 1545 COVID-19 Impacted Student from your education provider.

- This waiver only applies to the visa application charge.

Include family
You can include family members when you lodge your visa application. For student visas, your family member is:
- 
- your partner, or
- your or your partner's dependent child who is unmarried and has not turned 18 years of age.

- We cannot grant a student visa to your child if they have turned 18 years at the time your visa is finalised. They need to apply for their own visa.
- You must declare your family members in your student visa application even if they do not plan to travel with you to Australia. If you do not do this, your family members will not be eligible for a student visa to join you in Australia.
- Your family members can also apply as a subsequent entrant (at a later time, separate from your application) in ImmiAccount.
- Family members who apply for the visa must meet our requirements for health and character.
- Check the annual school costs you will need to pay for any dependent children to go to either public or private schools in Australia.

Only TOEFL iBT scores from a test taken on or before 25 July 2023 are accepted for Student visa purposes.




English language evidence exemptions

You do not need to provide evidence of an English test score with your visa application if one of the following applies:

you are a citizen and hold a passport from UK*, USA, Canada, NZ or Republic of Ireland 
you are an applicant who is a Foreign Affairs or, Defence sponsored student or a Secondary Exchange student (AASES)
you are enrolled in a principal course of study that is a registered school course, a standalone English Language Intensive Course for Overseas Students (ELICOS), a course registered to be delivered in a language other than English, or a registered post-graduate research course

Note: You may be required to provide evidence of an English test score with your visa application if you hold a British National Overseas (BNO) passport.







Have adequate health insurance

You and your family members must have and maintain adequate health insurance for the whole of your stay in Australia. To find out the length of coverage you will require, see student visa grant periods.
You and your family members must be covered by Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) from an approved Australian health insurance provider, unless an 'Exception' applies.
Applicants outside Australia
Your cover must start from the day you and your family arrive in Australia, not the day your course starts.
If you have been granted a visa and want to travel to Australia before your course begins, the OSHC start date must be the same as the date you arrive, not the date your course starts. Generally this is a minimum of 1 week to 1 month before your course starts. 
You must: 

ensure you don't enter Australia before your OSHC begins, and
maintain your OSHC until you leave Australia.

You may be refused entry to Australia if you cannot prove you have health insurance in place when you arrive.
Applicants in Australia
Applicants must have OSHC. If your previous visa required you to have health insurance, cover must be continuous with  no gap between your previous health cover and your OSHC.
Exceptions
You do not need to have OSHC if you are:

a Norwegian student covered by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme
a Swedish student covered by Kammarkollegiet
a Belgian student covered under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia

How to get Overseas Student Health Cover
To get OSHC:

find an approved provider
pay for your policy

Your education provider or agent might arrange OSHC for you. 
If your education provider arranges your OSHC coverage, you will need to know the name of your health insurance provider, the date that your policy starts and finishes and should be aware of the terms and conditions of your policy. Your education provider will also need to include your health insurance information on your Certificate of Enrolment (CoE).
If you arrange OSHC coverage yourself, you will need to know the policy number to include in the visa application.
We will refuse your visa application if you don't give us this information when you apply for your student visa. 
Insurance for family members
If you have a single OSHC policy and you have family members, including children born in Australia after your arrival, consider getting a family policy. Every member of your family must have health insurance. 
Any family member who joins you after you arrive in Australia must show us they have OSHC for the duration of their stay in Australia.

If you are in Australia:
You must hold an eligible substantive visa.
Note: a bridging visa is not a substantive visa.
If you do not hold an eligible substantive visa, you must apply within 28 days of:

holding a Student visa, a Special Purpose visa, or a dependent Diplomatic (temporary) visa or
being notified by the Tribunal that your visa cancellation has been set aside.

Note: you can only do this once. You cannot make a valid application for a student visa if you do not hold a substantive visa and you have previously been granted a visa based on an application made when you did not hold a substantive visa.
If you do not hold a substantive visa, you can't apply for a student visa if you have ever held a substantive visa that you applied for in Australia while unlawful.

## 4. Step by Step
Before you apply
Outside Australia - Apply for your visa at least 8 weeks before your course starts.
In Australia - Allow plenty of time to apply for your next visa, avoid waiting to the last day your current substantive visa expires in case of unexpected complications, as we may not always be able to help you.

Organise health exams

You might need to have health examinations. You can complete them before you apply. 
Find out the examinations you need and how to arrange them if you want to have them before you apply.



Get help with your application

Only some people can help you with your application. If you appoint someone to give you immigration assistance they must be:

a registered migration agent
a legal practitioner, or
an exempt person.

You can appoint anyone to receive documents on your behalf relating to your visa matter.




Have a valid passport
You and your family members must hold a valid passport in order to lodge a student visa application.
If you are in Australia and your current passport expires, you will need to renew it before you apply for your student visa.








Gather your documents
To see what you need to provide, use the Document Checklist Tool. Before you use this tool please read the disclaimer. 
Enter your country of passport and education provider to get an accurate document checklist. Choose the option 'I have not decided on a provider yet' in the tool if you have not yet chosen a provider.
The tool will tell you what you will need to provide evidence of. If the tool says you need to provide evidence of a certain thing, select 'Show steps' to see what kind of evidence we might accept.
Re-check the document checklist based on the country of passport and education provider just before you submit your application to be sure you have the most current list. The Document Checklist Tool is updated twice a year on 31 March and 30 September.

Provide an Acceptance Advice of Secondary Exchange Student form
Postgraduate research student required to remain in Australia for marking of your thesis 
Provide a letter from your education provider.




Evidence you have enough money for your stay

If the document checklist indicates you must provide evidence of your financial capacity, you must attach evidence to your visa application. We may refuse your visa without asking you for more information if you don't.
If we don't ask you to provide evidence you have enough money for your stay when you apply, we may ask you to provide this evidence while we are processing your application.
The living costs we ask you to declare and provide with your visa application is the minimum amount of money you need for the purpose of the visa. Actual living costs vary throughout Australia and may be much higher than what you need for the visa. We recommend you research the area you intend to live including the cost of living in that area
There are options to prove you have enough money for your stay.
You could give us evidence of:

deposits of money from a financial institution
government loans or loans from a financial institution
scholarships or similar financial support.

Annual income
Alternatively, you can provide evidence your parents or your partner had a personal annual income of at least AUD62,222 in the 12 months immediately before you apply. If you bring family members, you must show your parents’ or partner’s income is at least AUD72,592.
From 1 October 2023, you can provide evidence your parents or your partner had a personal income of at least AUD72,465 in the 12 months immediately before you apply. If you bring family members, you must show your parents’ or partner’s income is at least AUD84,543.
If both your parents are working we can consider their combined income. Provide evidence of your parents’ or partner’s income in the form of official government documents such as tax assessments less than 12 months old. We won’t accept bank statements or direct evidence from an employer.
 
Work out how much money you need for the visa
At a minimum, you must have enough money to pay for:

your travel
12 months of your course fees (or pro rata fees, if your course is less than 12 months)
12 months of living costs for you and any family members who come with you to Australia (or pro rata fees, if you are staying less than 12 months)
school fees for any school-age children who accompany you (or pro rata fees, if the child will be at school for less than 12 months).

Use the following information to work out how much money you need for the visa. To calculate pro rata costs, divide the annual cost by 365 and multiply the result by the number of days you intend to stay in Australia.
 
Living costs
12-month living costs are for:

students or guardians - AUD21,041
partners coming with you - AUD7,362
a child coming with you - AUD3,152.

From 1 October 2023, the 12-month living costs will increase to:

students or guardians - AUD24,505
partners coming with you - AUD8,574
a child coming with you - AUD3,670.

Course fees
Use the first 12 months of your course fees. If your course is 12 months or less, use the total cost. Deduct any costs you have already paid – you must provide evidence you have paid them, such as a receipt or Confirmation of Enrolment.
If you are in Australia and your course has already started, calculate the course fee for 12 months starting on the date you lodge your application.

Example 1: your course fee is AUD50,000 for 3 years. The fee for 12 months is the total course cost divided by the number of years you will be studying. AUD50,000 divided by 3 years = AUD16,666, less any amount you have already paid if relevant.
Example 2: your course fee is AUD15,000 for 10 months and you have already paid AUD5,000. Deduct the amount you have already paid from the total amount. AUD15,000 - AUD5,000 = AUD10,000.
Example 3: your course fee is AUD20,000 for 18 months. The fee for 12 months is the total divided by the total number of months, then multiplied by 12. (AUD20,000/18) x 12 = AUD13,333. Deduct any costs you have already paid.

Schooling costs
If you are including any school-age children in your application, add schooling costs of at least AUD8,296 per year for each child. Costs vary between states, territories and schools in Australia. You are responsible for finding out how much the child’s schooling will cost.
From 1 October 2023, if you are including any school-age children in your application, add schooling costs of at least AUD9,661 per year for each child.
You don’t have to provide evidence of schooling costs if you:

are a PhD student and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees have been waived, or
have received an Australian Commonwealth Government scholarship, including Foreign Affairs and Defence sponsored students, and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees have been waived.

You must provide evidence the child is enrolled.
 
Travel costs
As a guide, when you calculate how much money you need, include:

AUD2,500 for travel costs if you are applying from East or Southern Africa
AUD3,000 for travel costs if you are applying from West Africa
AUD2,000 for travel costs if you are applying from anywhere else outside Australia 
AUD1,000 for travel costs if you are applying in Australia. If you will be returning to Africa include AUD1,500.

For combined applications
Include the costs and expenses of the primary applicant. For family members also applying for the visa, include:

12 months living costs (or pro rata)
any school fees
travel expenses.

Other options
Secondary exchange students can prove they have enough money for their stay by providing a completed Acceptance Advice of Secondary Exchange Students (AASES) form.
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) students can prove they have enough money for their stay by providing a letter of support from DFAT. They must also provide proof of the financial capacity of any family members travelling with them.
Department of Defence students can prove they have enough money for their stay by providing a letter of support from the Department of Defence. They must also provide proof of the financial capacity of any family members travelling with them.
 
Family members who apply after we have granted you a visa (subsequent entrants)
Family members who apply to join you later must also, at a minimum, show us they have enough money to cover:

the costs and expenses of the student visa holder, including any remaining portion of the 12 months school fees minus any amount already paid
12 months living costs of all secondary applicants, including school fees
travel costs for all secondary applicants.

 
Evidence you have genuine access to the money
If we ask you to provide evidence of financial capacity you must also prove you have access to it. 
If someone else is providing you funds, give us:

evidence of your relationship with them
their identity documents
evidence of any financial support they have given you or another student visa holder in the past.

If the financial support provided involves a business, show us proof the business is operating.
If you are providing evidence of deposits of money, explain their source.
Any education loan to cover your tuition or living costs should be paid out according to the agreement between you, the bank and the education provider. If you receive any payments before we make a decision on your application, give us evidence including the terms of the loan and the full amount you will be paid.
If you are relying on another kind of loan, provide:

evidence of the security you used
the terms of the loan
evidence you can cover ongoing costs.

The best evidence you can provide of genuine access to funds if you are relying on a loan is evidence of disbursement.
Let your provider know any conditions on your education loan. Some loans offer deferred repayment against your future earnings. These loans can be conditional on you studying only a specified course with a certain provider.




Evidence you are exempt from paying a visa application charge (VAC):

The following student visa applicants are not required to pay a visa application charge (VAC):

Students awarded a scholarship funded by the Commonwealth Government of Australia
Students and family members supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
Student and family members supported by the Department of Defence
Secondary exchange students
Students affected by education provider default and lodge a new student visa application within 12 months of the provider default day
Family members of students enrolled in a postgraduate research course
Students affected by COVID-19.

If you are not sure, you should not claim exemption. We will not accept your application if you are not eligible and this may have consequences if you are in Australia. An invalid application outcome could affect your visa status and you may not be eligible if your visa has already expired to apply for a further visa.
Note:

You are not Commonwealth sponsored if you are sponsored by the government in your home country or your government has provided you with a loan. Most Commonwealth sponsored students are enrolled in post graduate research courses.
If your education provider is still operating but was unable to deliver the course you were enrolled in, then you are not affected by education provider default.  





Overseas Student Health Cover 

You must include proof of paid adequate health insurance for the proposed duration of your visa see student visa grant periods.
Health insurance must be Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) covering everyone included in your application.
If you don’t provide your OSHC in your application form, we will refuse your visa application. 
If you or your agent have organised OSHC, and included this information on your CoE, you will need to include the name of your health insurance provider, the dates your policy starts and finishes and the policy number in your application form.
If your education provider arranged your OSHC, you will need to include the name of your health insurance provider and the dates your policy starts and finishes in your application.You do not need to include the policy number in your application. 
Make sure there is no gap in your coverage if you are studying with more than one education provider and both providers arrange OSHC for you. The second policy must begin as soon as the first expires.
Note: If you are from Norway, Sweden or Belgium, you might not have to obtain OSHC. See information on exceptions in the 'Have adequate health insurance' section on the Eligibility page.




Genuine temporary entrant documents

Every Student visa applicant must provide evidence they are a genuine temporary entrant (GTE). In the online student visa application form, you will need to provide a statement of purpose in English addressing the GTE requirement.  This statement is to be 300 words in total (a 2000 character limit applies).
In addition to the written statement in the application form, you will also need to attach supporting documents to ImmiAccount.
See how to provide evidence you are a genuine temporary entrant. 




Student visa English language requirements

Do not provide false and misleading information
Provide accurate information. See what happens if you can't prove your identity or don't provide true information.





Apply online


Create or log in to ImmiAccount
Attach documents
Pay the visa application charge

Paying the application charge 
When you submit your application you must:

pay for you and your family members or your application will not be valid
or
provide proof of exemption as shown in 'Step by step', Gather your documents.

If your visa cancellation was set aside by the Tribunal you can’t apply online.  Instead submit a ImmiAccount technical support form.
Note: a valid application must be made within the eligibility timeframe as late applications will not be accepted.
See how to resolve error messages when submitting online.
Note: 

We cannot grant a student visa to your child if they are 18 years or over at the time your visa is finished. Instead, they should apply for their own visa.
Where subsequent entrants are siblings (two or more children with no parent), they must each make a seperate subsequent entrant student visa application and pay the base visa application charge to join their parent.








After you apply
See what you can and must do after you apply.
You should respond to any requests for information promptly. You do not need to wait until the deadline to respond to a Departmental request for further information.  You should also regularly log into your ImmiAccounts to check for messages from the Department and respond promptly.
You should avoid booking travel before your visa has been finalised. 

Status updates
If it is within standard processing times do not call. We can't provide any further updates on the application's progress. You can see if we have asked for more information in your ImmiAccount.





Biometrics 

We might ask for biometrics. Most applicants will be advised immediately after submitting an application if you need to provide biometrics. You will receive a letter and will also be able to see this request in your ImmiAccount. You will be given 14 days to provide biometrics so it is important to arrange an appointment quickly using the instructions in the request letter.
You must provide biometrics before travelling to Australia. 




Health exams

If you did not have health examinations before you applied, check ImmiAccount to find out if you need them.
See the medical referral letter with your Health Assessment Portal (HAP) ID and further directions in ImmiAccount. 




Stay lawful in Australia

Make sure you stay lawful by holding a valid visa while we process your application.
If you were in Australia when you applied for this visa, you were granted a Bridging visa A (BVA). If your current visa expires before we decide on your application, the BVA will start. You can stay in Australia on the BVA while we process your new visa application. You cannot travel on the BVA - there is no right of return on this visa; it cancels on departure.
Do not cancel your current visa. If you do, you will:

be staying in Australia unlawfully
not be eligible for a Bridging visa A

Learn more about visa expiry.




Travel after you apply 

You do not have to tell us if you want to travel outside Australia while we process your application. This is because you can be outside Australia when we make a decision.
But if you leave Australia, make sure your visa allows you to return. If you have a Bridging visa A, it will cease if you leave Australia.
If you have a BVA and substantial reasons for travel, then a Bridging visa B (BVB) enables return to Australia while your application is being processed.
To see if you can return on your current visa, check VEVO.
Learn about visa expiry.




Providing more information
Lodging a complete application will ensure your visa is not delayed. If you did not attach all your documents when you applied, attach them as soon as you can in ImmiAccount. The Department may finalise your application based on the information you provided when you first lodged your visa, so it is recommended that you lodge a complete application. You can attach a maximum of 60 documents. We might also ask you to provide more information.





Add family members

Your eligible family members can:

accompany you to Australia if you have included them in your visa application
join you in Australia, after you have been granted your visa, as a subsequent entrant. You must have declared these family members in your student visa application.

Declare all family members on your application, even if they do not plan to travel with you to Australia. If you do not do this, your family members will not be eligible for a student visa to join you in Australia.
If you did not declare a family member and they need to join you in Australia at a later date, you will need to apply for a new student visa including them and explain why they were not included on your application. An exception to this is if they became your family members after your student visa was granted and before a subsequent application is made.
