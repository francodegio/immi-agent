Processing times
For an indication of processing times for this visa, use the visa processing time guide tool. This will show the processing times for recently decided applications. It is a guide only and not specific to your application.
- The Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) receives more applications each year than the number of places available. Applicants who do not meet the Australian Government’s resettlement priorities are not likely to be successful.
- The decision process could take many months. Your application can take longer to process if:
- 
- your application form is not filled in correctly
- you do not include all the documents we need, or we need more information from you
- it takes us time to verify your information.
- 
- Priorities
- SHP applications are processed in order of priority group.
- Priority groups within the SHP are as follows:
- 
- proposer is an immediate family member (partner or dependent child, or, if the proposer is under 18 years of age, the proposer's parent) and they:
- 
- were granted a Class XB visa, or
- are an Australian citizen who held a Protection or Resolution of Status visa.
- 
- You must also meet the split-family criteria. This means your proposer:
- was a member of your immediate family when we granted their visa
- told us about your relationship before we granted their visa, and
- proposed your visa application within 5 years of us granting their visa
- 
- 
- You do not meet the split-family criteria and your proposer is a close family member (partner, child, parent or sibling), and does not hold a Protection or Resolution of Status visa.
- Your proposer is an extended family member (grandparent, grandchild, cousin, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew), and does not hold a Protection or Resolution of Status visa.
- Your proposer is a distant relative, friend or community organisation, and does not hold a Protection or Resolution of Status visa.
- Your proposer holds a Protection or Resolution of Status visa.
- 

Your obligations
You must enter Australia before the first entry arrival date (initial arrival date) specified in your grant letter.
- You and your family members must obey all Australian laws.

Travel
You and your proposer or approved proposing organisation are responsible for arranging your travel to Australia. 
- If the first entry arrival date (initial arrival date) specified in your grant letter has passed, contact the visa processing office for a travel facilitation letter. We may first ask you to undergo a fresh medical examination.
- You can travel to and from Australia for 5 years from the date we grant the visa. After 5 years you will need a Resident Return (RRV) visa (subclass 155) or (subclass 157) to re-enter Australia.
