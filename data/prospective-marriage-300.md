Visa outcome

you are in Australia at any time during the COVID-19 concession period, and
applied for your visa before the end of the COVID-19 concession period; and
you meet all visa criteria.

The COVID-19 concession period started on 1 February 2020 and is an interim arrangement. We are yet to determine the end date of the concession period. The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs will determine this end date.
We cannot grant you a visa if you do not apply during the COVID-19 concession period and come to Australia after that period has ended.
 
Outside Australia
If you are outside Australia and meet the visa grant requirements, we can grant you the visa.
We will tell you our decision in writing. Keep a copy of the decision.
If we grant your visa, we will tell you:

your visa grant number
