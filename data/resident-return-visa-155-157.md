## 2. About this visa
With this visa you can

- travel to and from Australia as a permanent resident until the travel facility of your visa expires 
- 
- If you leave Australia after your permanent visa travel facility has expired, you will not be able to return to Australia as a permanent resident. If you wish to return to Australia as a permanent resident, you must apply for and be granted this visa before your arrival in Australia.
- If you are already in Australia as a permanent resident, you do not need to apply for this visa if you do not wish to travel.
- There are no limits on the number of Resident Return visas (RRV) you can apply for.
- For more information, see Overseas travel as a permanent resident.
- Check the travel facility expiry date of your permanent visa before you apply for an RRV to see if it covers your intended travel period. You can check this on VEVO.

Cost 
  for each applicant if you apply online (you must apply online unless we authorise you to apply on paper).
- AUD545 for each applicant if we authorise you to apply on paper. If you are exempt from paying the Non-internet application charge a repayment will automatically be processed and the payment returned to you.
- You might also have to pay for other costs including health checks, police certificates and biometrics. We will advise you if this is required.
- To work out what your visa will cost, use the Visa Pricing Estimator. The estimator does not take into account the other costs.

RRV Refunds
Generally, you will not be given a refund just because:
- 
- your RRV application was refused
- you lost the travel facility remaining on your previous visa when your RRV was granted
- you did not use the travel facility attached to your RRV (regardless of the reason).
- 
- If you think we made a mistake that caused you to lodge your RRV application in error, let us know. Provide documentary evidence with your request to support your claim.

How long the travel facility lasts
If you are granted an RRV, the travel facility will vary depending on your circumstances.
- If you : 
- 
- were present in Australia for a total of at least 2 years in the last 5 years as a permanent visa holder or Australian citizen, then you meet what is known as the ‘residence requirement’ and will be given a 5-year travel facility on your RRV.
- have not met the ‘residence requirement’ but have demonstrated you have substantial ties with Australia that benefit Australia, then you can only be given a maximum of 12 months travel facility on your RRV. See ‘eligibility’ for the requirements.
- have applied as a member of the family unit of a person who already holds an RRV, or who has lodged a separate application for an RRV and meets the time of application criteria for grant, then you can only be given a maximum of 12 months travel facility on your RRV.
- have not met any of the above requirements, but have compelling and compassionate reasons for departure, then you can only be given 3 months travel facility on your RRV (subclass 157) if you have not been absent from Australia in the 5 years prior to making an application.
- 
- It is not possible to carry over the remaining travel facility from any previous visa to the subsequently granted RRV. You will not be able to get a refund for any lost travel facility.
- You will not be able to request extension of travel facility, regardless of the circumstances (within or outside of your control).
- It is not possible to postpone the grant of an RRV once all visa requirements are met.
- If you have already applied for an RRV and find that the travel facility attached to your current permanent visa will cover your intended travel period, you should consider withdrawing your pending RRV application. You should do this in writing as soon as possible. See You want to withdraw a visa application.
- If you hold an RRV, you should always be aware of the expiry date of the travel facility before any travel arrangements are made. You can check this on VEVO.
- We will send you a reminder about the expiry of the travel facility of your RRV (Subclass 155) visa. We will not send you a reminder if you have a pending RRV application. If you need to travel, you should apply for a new RRV before your existing travel facility expires. This will help you avoid delays. For more information about the Travel Facility Expiry Reminder (TFER) and which permanent visa holders receive them, see Overseas travel as a permanent resident.
- If you return to Australia without a permanent visa and a valid travel facility (for example, when holding a visitor visa), this might impact your:
- 
- entitlements as a permanent resident
- ability to satisfy the permanent residence requirements when applying for Australian citizenship or another RRV.
- 
- You do not need to apply for an RRV if:
- 
- you are in Australia,
- your travel facility has expired, and
- you do not wish to travel.
- 

Include family
You can't include family members in your application.
- If other family members are also applying for this visa separately at the same time, then you can have all your applications processed together, if you declare them in your application.
- While you can’t include family members as secondary visa applicants in your application, you should provide information about any immediate family members who are Australian citizens or permanent residents in your application. This is important, if you are trying to show that you have substantial ties of benefit to Australia.

Apply from
You can be in or outside Australia when you apply for the visa but not in immigration clearance. If we authorise you to apply using a paper form, you must follow the instructions given to you otherwise your application may be invalid. If your application is invalid, it cannot be considered. You cannot apply in person.
- If you have applied for your visa but have not been granted it and you need to travel urgently see contact us.

Processing times
For an indication of processing times for this visa, use the visa processing time guide tool. This will show the processing times for recently decided applications. It is a guide only and not specific to your application.
- Generally, applications that:
- 
- meet the residence requirements will be processed within 5 working days from lodgement
- do not meet the residence requirement will take longer to process. For example, this can be 12 weeks from lodgement or more.
- 
- Your application can also take longer to process if:
- 
- you do not fill it in correctly
- you do not include all the documents we need
- we need more information from you
- it takes us time to verify your information
- 
- Your application will not be processed if you do not pay the correct application charge. If necessary, you will be notified and any charges repaid.

Your obligations

- See when your existing travel facility ends in VEVO.

Visa label
We will digitally link your visa to your valid travel document. You will not get a label in your passport.




## 3. Elegibility
Be either

an Australian permanent resident
a former Australian permanent resident whose last permanent visa was not cancelled, or
a former Australian citizen who lost or renounced citizenship.

Australian citizens are not eligible to apply for an RRV.
 
When an RRV application is lodged, applicants are assessed against the criteria for both subclass 155 and 157 visas. If the requirements for subclass 155 RRV are not met, and the applicant is eligible for a subclass 157 RRV, the maximum travel facility that can be granted with a subclass 157 RRV is 3 months.
 
Even if you hold a temporary visa, you may still be eligible for an RRV if you had been a permanent visa holder or an Australian citizen.
 
If you were an Australian permanent visa holder who returned to Australia on a temporary visa (such as an Electronic Travel Authority), you should consider applying for an RRV as soon as possible if you intend to remain permanently in Australia – see permanent resident and how to stay lawful under After you apply.





Age requirement
There are no age requirements for RRV applicants.





Meet our residence or substantial ties requirements

You must either:

have been present in Australia for 2 years in the last 5 years as the holder of a permanent visa (or permanent entry permit), or as an Australian citizen, in which case you will get a 5-year travel facility

OR

be outside Australia and:

not absent for 5 continuous years or more before the date of application (unless you have compelling reasons), and
hold a permanent visa or last left Australia as a permanent resident or citizen (but subsequently lost citizenship), and
be able to demonstrate substantial ties to Australia that are of benefit to Australia,



in which case you can only be given a maximum 12 months travel facility
OR

be outside Australia and:

were an Australian citizen or permanent resident less than 10 years before you applied, and
not absent from Australia for periods that total more than 5 years (unless you have compelling reasons) between the date you left Australia as a permanent resident or citizen and the date of application, and
be able to demonstrate substantial ties to Australia that are of benefit to Australia,



in which case you can only be given a maximum 12 months travel facility
OR

be in Australia and:

be able to demonstrate substantial ties to Australia that are of benefit to Australia, and
not been absent for 5 continuous years since grant of your most recent permanent visa or when you stopped being an Australian citizen (unless you have compelling reasons)



in which case you can only be given a maximum 12 months travel facility
OR

be the member of family unit of a person who already holds an RRV or has lodged a separate application for an RRV, and meets the time of application criteria for grant, in which case you can only be given a maximum 12 months travel facility.

In calculating the residence requirement relating to the first dot-point above, the:

2-year period is counted as 730 days
5-year period is counted back from the RRV application lodgement date (not from the date of RRV decision)
date of arrival and date of departure are both included in the count of days in Australia. Only one day is counted if the applicant arrives and departs on the same day. Only one day is counted if a visa expires and another one is granted on the same day. A part-day spent in Australia by a permanent visa holder is counted as a full day. 


Have substantial ties
Your ties must be both substantial and of benefit to Australia. Your ties can be:

business ties 
cultural ties 
employment ties 
personal ties (including family ties)

You can see examples of how to demonstrate these ties in Step by step under Gather your documents.








Not hold an Authority to Return or Return Endorsement

You are not eligible for an RRV if you hold a Transitional (permanent) visa because you were issued either an:

Authority to Return (issued between 1 March 1976 to 31 August 1979)
Return Endorsement (issued between 1 September 1979 and 31 December 1986)

If you hold one of these, see Overseas travel as a permanent resident.




Meet character requirement

You must meet our character requirement.



Not have cancellation action against your business skills visa

You might not be eligible for this visa if you have cancellation action on business grounds for your business skills visa. See the following visas:

Class EA subclass 132 visa
Class BH subclass 840-846 visas (repealed)
Class EB subclass 188 visa
Class UR subclass 160-165 visas
Class EC subclass 888 visas

You might not be eligible for this visa if you are, or were the holder of one of the above visas and have:

been granted a subclass 155, 157 or 159 visa
cancellation action for your subclass 155, 157 or 159 visa on the same business visa grounds.

You may not be eligible for this visa if you are or were a family member of a person affected by the above, and either hold or have held one of the above visa subclasses as a dependant family member.




Not have had a visa cancelled or a previous application refused

We will consider your immigration history when we make a decision on your application, which means you might not be eligible for this visa if you have had a visa cancelled or refused.
In some circumstances you may still apply for a permanent visa if you have had a visa cancelled or an application refused, see Limitations on applications in Australia.
If applying for a visa from outside Australia, see Can I go to Australia.
If you want immigration assistance, see Who can help with your visa application.







## 4. Step by Step
Before you apply
Check your current visa status and travel facility prior to applying to determine if an application for a Resident Return visa is necessary. You can check this through VEVO. Note: you may not get a refund after lodging your application – see Cost.
You should have a valid passport or other travel document before we grant this visa. 
If you need a new passport, plan to get it before you apply for this visa.
If you get a new passport after you apply, tell us your new passport information as soon as possible. See how to tell us your passport has changed.

Get help with your application

Only some people can help you with your application. If you appoint someone to give you immigration assistance they must be:

a registered migration agent
a legal practitioner, or
an exempt person.

You can appoint anyone to receive documents on your behalf relating to your visa matter.






Gather your documents
You must apply online. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as an ImmiAccount technical issue, will we authorise you to lodge on paper. We might grant you the visa automatically without you needing to provide any documents if:

you are an Australian Permanent resident
you have resided in Australia for a total of at least 2 years in the 5 years as a permanent visa holder or Australian citizen before lodging your application
your name and date of birth have not changed since the granting of your last visa
you meet the character requirement



Provide accurate documents 

Provide accurate information. See what happens if you can't prove your identity or don't provide true information.

Historical documents 

Provide evidence of your permanent residency with your visa application, particularly if you migrated to Australia before 1990. This could include:

the pages of your old expired passport(s), which should include your photo, personal details, passport issue and expiry dates, and evidence of permanent residency wet stamps or printed visa labels
any Certificate of Evidence of Resident Status (CERS) issued to you before this product was abolished on 1 June 2016
any separate permanent visa (or permanent entry permit) documentation issued to you overseas before and / or on your arrival in Australia
any historical documentation you have received to this effect from the National Archives of Australia (NAA).

In addition to the above, you should provide a copy of your current passport.
If you migrated to Australia before 1990 and you have no evidence of your permanent residency, you should contact NAA in the first instance and obtain any necessary documentation prior to lodging your application. This includes any international movement records before 1990, and any relevant visa documentation. Failing to do so may result in significant delays in processing your application.  




Substantial ties and compelling reasons for absence documents

If you do not meet the residence requirement, you must provide documents that show evidence of your substantial ties, which are of benefit to Australia, and

compelling reasons for any absences from Australia of 5 or more continuous years or
if you are outside Australia and were an Australian citizen or permanent resident less than 10 years before the application, compelling reasons for any periods of absence that total more than 5 years from the date you last departed Australia

Provide a statement that shows your ties are both substantial and of benefit to Australia. There may be delays in processing your application if you do not attach documents to your application showing that your ties are both substantial and of benefit to Australia.
Examples of documents you can attach are (but not limited to):
 
Business ties documents

company reports defining your role and authority
business transactions
partnership or joint venture agreements

This may include regarding Australia as home or having an intention to reside in Australia.

Proving substantial personal ties to Australia

you were an Australian citizen or permanent resident less than 10 years before you applied for a RRV – you must have compelling reasons for any absence(s) that amount to 5 years in total between the date you departed Australia as a citizen or permanent resident and the date of application.

You are not eligible for an RRV if you are outside Australia when you apply and you were not an Australian citizen or permanent resident in the 10 years immediately before the application unless either of the above applies to you.
If you are in Australia when you apply

you must have compelling reasons for any absence of more than 5 continuous years since the grant of your most recent permanent visa, or since you ceased to be an Australian citizen.

Your reasons should include any elements which you thought were compelling at the time. Although not mandatory, you should indicate how the compelling reasons for your absence link to the entirety of your absence from Australia. This could be done by a statement explaining the circumstances of your absence(s). Attach other documents showing your compelling reasons for absence(s) from Australia to your application, or there may be delays in processing your application. Examples of documents you can attach are (but not limited to):

severe illness or death of an overseas family member,
work or study commitments by the applicant or the applicant’s partner,
the applicant is living overseas in an ongoing relationship with a partner, or has minor children,

the applicant has been involved in legal proceedings overseas and the timing was beyond the applicant’s control,
the applicant has been caught up in a natural disaster, political uprising, pandemic, or other similar event preventing them from travel.

It will take us longer to process your application if we need to ask you for more documents. We may still, however, make a decision on your application based on any available information without requesting any additional information from you. As such, it is very important that you read all information on the website, and provide a complete application at the time of lodgement.
