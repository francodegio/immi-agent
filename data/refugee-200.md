Processing times
For an indication of processing times for this visa, use the visa processing time guide tool. This will show the processing times for recently decided applications. It is a guide only and not specific to your application.
- The decision process could take many months, even years. The number of applications we receive for resettlement each year is far greater than available visas.
- Your application could take longer if you need character or health checks (including chest x-rays), if you need to provide more information, or if your application is incomplete.
- Processing times also vary according to individual and family circumstances, such as any health conditions that might require testing or treatment.
- We will contact you at key stages of processing and when a decision is made.
- Priority processing
- We give priority to most vulnerable applicants:
- 
- assessed as refugees by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and
- referred to Australia for resettlement, or
- proposed by an immediate family member (for example, spouses and minor aged children) who has a Refugee category visa (subclasses 200,201,203 or 204)
- 
- Because of the limited number of resettlement places available each year and the high demand for them, we accept applicants in most compelling circumstances only.

Your obligations 
You must enter Australia before the first entry arrival date (initial arrival date) specified in your grant letter.
- You and your family members must obey all Australian laws.

Travel
Your travel to Australia will be arranged by the Department at no cost to you. If the first entry arrival date (initial arrival date) specified in your grant letter has passed, we may issue you with a travel facilitation letter. We may first ask you to undergo a fresh medical examination. 
- You can travel to and from Australia for 5 years from the date we grant the visa. After 5 years you will need a Resident Return (RRV) visa (subclass 155) or (subclass 157) to re-enter Australia as a permanent resident.

Additional information 
Note: The number of applications we receive for resettlement each year is far greater than available visas.
