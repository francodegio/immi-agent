## 2. About this visa
About this authority
Under the Special Purpose visa framework, a Crew Travel Authority (subclass 942) is an electronic immigration record. Commercial airlines register crew members for Crew Travel Authorities to aid uplift. The registration is valid for the life of the passport. Commercial airlines can use the Carrier Portal to check that their international aircrew can legally enter Australia.
- International airline flights include:
- 
- commercial passenger flights or
- chartered passenger flights or
- freight or cargo flights
- 
- Crew members with Australian or New Zealand passports do not need Crew Travel Authorities.
- If you are a New Zealand citizen further information regarding your entry requirements, entitlements and pathway to permanent residence and citizenship can be found at the New Zealand citizens webpage.

Private flight operators
People operating private flights can't register for, or use a Crew Travel Authority (subclass 942) to enter Australia. The flight must be a commercial or chartered flight carrying passengers or cargo.
- To see what other visas you might be eligible for use the Visa Finder. 

With this travel authority you can

- visit Australia as part of your work as an international airline crew member or aircraft safety inspector who is employed by a foreign government

How long you can stay
If you are an international airline crew member or aircraft safety inspector, you can stay in Australia for up to 30 days.

New Zealand passport holders
If you are a New Zealand citizen crew member who arrives in Australia and do not hold another visa (such as a permanent residence visa) and you wish to remain in Australia longer than the above periods, you should not enter Australia via SmartGate. Instead, you should approach a border clearance officer and make an application to be granted a Special Category visa (subclass 444) by:
- 
- completing an incoming passenger card and
- presenting your New Zealand passport
- 
- The SCV will allow you to live, visit, work and study in Australia.
- When you leave Australia, your SCV will end. Next time you enter Australia, you will apply for a new SCV.
- Entering Australia on a Special Purpose visa as a crew member rather than an SCV may impact your status as a resident for social security purposes.
- If you apply for the SCV after you arrive in Australia, you will need to apply online and attend an appointment. For further information see New Zealand citizens

Stay longer
You can't stay in Australia as the holder of a Special Purpose visa longer than allowed. You must apply for another type of visa if you want to stay longer.
