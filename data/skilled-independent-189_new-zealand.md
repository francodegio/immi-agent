## 3. Elegibility



## 4. Step by Step
After you apply
See what you can and must do after you apply.

What will happen after you apply

We will let you know when we have received your application.
There are other things you need to know and might need to do.




Status updates

We don't give updates on applications within the standard processing time.
You can check if we need more information from you in ImmiAccount




Travel after you apply

If you are in Australia, you don't have to tell us if you want to travel outside Australia while we process your application. This is because you can be outside Australia when we make a decision.
But if you leave Australia, make sure you have a valid visa to return. To see if you can return on your current visa, check VEVO
Learn about visa expiry. 




Health exams 

If you didn't have health examinations before you applied, we will let you know if you need them.




Biometrics 

We might ask for biometrics. We will let you know if you need to provide them.




Attach more documents

If you did not attach all documents when you applied, attach them as soon as you can in ImmiAccount.
We might also ask you to provide more information; however we are not obliged to do so and may make a decision on your application without asking for more documents.




Stay lawful 

If you are in Australia, make sure you stay lawful by holding a valid visa while we process your application.
If you currently hold Special Category visa subclass 444 visa, this visa will remain in effect while you are in Australia.
If you made a valid application for this visa in Australia, you are usually eligible to be granted a bridging visa. If your current visa expires before we decide on your application,  the bridging visa will come into effect if you do not hold another substantive visa. A substantive visa includes the subclass 444.
You can stay in Australia lawfully as the holder of a substantive or bridging visa while we process your visa application. However, as your subclass 189 visa application will not be processed unless you hold a subclass 444 visa, check how your subclass 444 could cease.
